            This video provides a quick rundown on what HTML is and gives the viewers watching a short summary on what HTML is and how to use the syntax in HTML.
            The HTML Page structure is structured as there is a header that contains a title with after being the body containing a heading with a number of 
            paragraph depending on the user's choice. The doctype for HTML5 would be using DOCTYPE html, while in previous version such as HTML 4.01 Strict, it 
            would be verylong as it would have the user define it as strict or transitional which can lead to complexity in terms of knowing what type the document 
            should be. When commenting on within an HTML editor, using the less than < followed by a exclamation point with two hyphen will allow you to comment 
            within the file and it will not show up within the actual webpage.

            can mostly see on your website, while the Back-End is the parts what you can't see such as the logics and functionality that is making the website allow
            to work properly. HTML contains all of the content that is currently on the webpage and is what the browser loads up when you visit a particular website.
            CSS helps customize all of the HTML contents into a design of your choosing, while Javascript adds functionality to inputs performed by the users within 
            the website.
