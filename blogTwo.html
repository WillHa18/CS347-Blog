        What I have learned about web development from this video is that HTML files are made up of texts and tags. Tags are the basis to where it can modify the text that is 
        in the HTML file to sections, apply styles, add links, etc. There are also standalone tags that can load additional asset files or links to other html files that you 
        can expand upon for your file to include tabs and or css files. In CSS files, attributes are the styles that are applied to referenced tags that are either adjusted
        or modified in the CSS files to the developer's preferences. Script tags allows the developer to load their JavaScript files from their web servers or over the internet.
        Javascript can help add listeners or events that allows the webpage to either help the user log in or change the HTML to update the visual of the website, or help validate
        data when it's time to send data to the web servers.

        To make your website live on the front-end, either you can static host by fetching your HTML files from the server or CPanel host through a control panel. Server Side
        Rendering allows framework, such as React and Vue to run on the server, mainly for better SEO, easy routing, and boost performance. Static Site Generators such as Gatsby 
        and Gridsome allows your website to generate at build time as opposed to real-time in order to have the website be more faster and more secure. For the back-end side of 
        web development, back-end developer pick a Server Side Language to understand how data is being transmitted and how website respond to the data and what to do with it. 
        Examples of Server Side Languages include Node.js, Ruby, PHP, etc, all of these can help focus on data, modeling, and HTTP requests/responses. Full Stack developers 
        must be comfortable with building the UI ansd knowledge of handling of the servers, understand the language to comprehend the data, and must be sucessful at deploying 
        full stack projects.
