            It is the first day of winter break. My mother encouraged me to keep my brain from wasting away and handed me this book on the C programming language that she used in college:

            I read the book cover to cover. All one needed back in the day was to install a compiler. Mom had it easy. She'd freak out if I showed her 
            <span class = "node">node_modules</span>. Perhaps someday computing will be simple again. But I think there's a law somewhere that says technological complexity will only increase.
            Once I finished, I wrote my first C program. Here it is:
        </p>
        <pre id="code">
        #include &lt;stdio.h&gt;

        int main(int argc, char **argv) {
            printf("Hello, world!\n");
        }
        </pre>
        <span class="keyword">I will never write another.</span>  Here's to a lifetime of learning!
