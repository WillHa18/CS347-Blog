            This video provides a demonstrations on the properties of flexbox and provides examples on how to use flexbox on your HTML files for your
            website. There are two axis that goes across the flexbox container which are called the Main Axis (horizontal) and the Cross Axis (Vertical),
            and will flip depending on which flex-direction the user provides it with. Justify-content allows you to adjust spacing upon the Main Axis, 
            while Align-items will adjust the items based on the cross axis. Therefore if you want the items to have more space horizontally, then you 
            would have to use the justify-content proprty to add spaces, while align-items to shrink or enlarge the items vertically. The items within 
            the flex box container are meant to override the inital settings given by the flexbox container. Flex-shrink, align-self, order, etc can 
            help adjust the items individually.

            This video explains the basic use of flexbox and provides a simplified explanation on how the properties of flexbox works. When starting out
            with flexbox, the flex display property is moving each of the div classes (if the user provided those classes) each into their own separate 
            columns. Flexbox sizing differ depending on the content that is within the flexboxes. For example in the video he demonstrated that two of 
            the inital columns were roughly aroung 955px while the center was around 2600px due to the center having more words to condense inside of the
            middle column. All flex values, such as flex-shrink, are equal throughout each column, so each column will shrink and grow at the same rate 
            unless stated otherwise by the user.
