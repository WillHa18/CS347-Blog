            This video provides a quick rundown on how CSS positioning works, while giving examples on samples of differing positions for parents and their childs.
            Static positioning is when similar to how HTML layout looks when you first type it out, for example, the first child written in HTML will always appear before
            the second or third child and so forth. Relative position is similar to static positioning with a few key differences. Relative positioning is able to change 
            the position of an element relative to where it's origin is, such as top, left, right, and bottom. Absolute positioning is rendering as if that element doesn't 
            exist, in other words, the code removes the element from the document flow and makes it useful for when if you want to place an object at a specific area but 
            don't want anything else to move around it. Fixed positioning is when you want an object to remain at that specific coordinates no matter how much the user 
            scroll down or moves the webpage. Sticky positioning is when if you move the webpage, the element will move until it hits the top of the page and it's positioning
            will now become fixed

            This video demonstrates how block, inline and inline-block works in CSS. Outline allows you to have a box outside of your content, while borders will add to the total
            size of the webpage. Block-level element will always stack on top of each other and will take up all available space that they can due to default setting of width 
            being set to 100%. Inline element are elements that are not placed on top of each other, but rather if you want it continuous without breaking it into a new line. 
            Trying to change an inline element height or margin won't do anything to the layout, so you would need to change the display to an inline block if you want a specific 
            element to appear in a different point rather than in the inline part of a specific element.
